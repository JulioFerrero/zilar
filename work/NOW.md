# Now

The live picture: what runs, what is next, what waits for Julio. The lead rewrites this file after every launch, merge or block, and commits it with the board. The full task list is `BOARD.md`; the rules are `CLAUDE.md` and `docs/LEAD_LOOP.md`.

Last updated: 2026-10-05, after merging T-0204 (all three token-saving tasks A, B, C are in; autopilot restarted). T-0210 (speed line for `lead watch`) waits for T-0209.

Token saving check: the first fresh-session fix round (T-0191 round 1) started at ~21k context instead of the old session's ~158k per step.

Known issue: `pnpm install` flips two `transitivePeerDependencies` entries (`bufferutil`, `utf-8-validate`, under the `metro-runtime` block of `pnpm-lock.yaml`) between worktrees: T-0203 added them, T-0204 removed them. Harmless, but it puts lockfile noise in every task. Later: an audit task to find why (pnpm version or install order).

Models (Julio, 2026-10-05): default `opencode/muse-spark-1.3-contributor-free`; MiniMax M3 only for the easiest exact tasks; billed `meta/muse-spark-1.3-contributor` is the fallback if the free listing hits limits.

## Running (max 4)

| Task | What | Step | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| T-0191 | Mobile sticker pack editor | coding | Muse (billed); brief `docs/design/briefs/T-0191-sticker-editor.md`; needs phone:smoke |
| T-0209 | `lead watch`: live terminal view of the workers (Julio asked) | coding | MiniMax; the lead runs `pnpm lead:watch` in a small terminal before merging |

## Next, in order

1. T-0210 `lead watch` speed line (tok/s, s/step, ctx, sparkline), MiniMax, after T-0209 merges; re-check the spec against the merged `watch.ts` first
   (The first fix round in a fresh session will be the first real test of T-0202.)
2. T-0207 Telegram import sheet on the free Muse (after T-0191; spec and brief ready)
3. Specs for T-0189 and T-0190 from `docs/audit/mobile-parity-gaps.md` (re-check every fact in the code)

## MiniMax M3 scorecard (Julio, 2026-10-05: give it harder tasks, no replays)

| Task | Difficulty | Rounds | Pre-review | Tokens in | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| T-0205 | easy (devtools parse) | 0 | clean, 2 nits | 0.49M | exact to spec |
| T-0194 | easy (guard tests) | 0 | clean, 0 nits | 1.4M | did the negative test properly |
| T-0195 | medium (docs audit) | 2 | round 1: 7 should-fix (invented strings, false claims, wrong citations) | 8.1M+ | merged; lead spot-check 9/10 citations exact |

## Free-model benchmark (2026-10-05, 5 hard prompts, one run each, graded by the lead)

Prompts and outputs: `~/.claude/jobs/fcd95e40/tmp/bench/` (temporary). Scores: `opencode/muse-spark-1.3-contributor-free` 5/5 (fastest, 26 s avg, concise, proposed our real T-0198 fix); `opencode/mimo-v2.6-flash-free` 5/5; `opencode-go/longcat-2.5-preview-free` 5/5; `opencode/nemotron-3-ultra-free` 5/5 (one invented issue); `opencode-go/space-bunny-free` 4/5 (wrong event-loop order, most thorough elsewhere); `minimax-coding-plan/MiniMax-M3` 2/5 (wrong event loop and tiling, a fix that does not work across processes). `opencode-go/ox-alpha-free` unavailable, `opencode/fledge-alpha-free` not available in our country. Waiting for Julio: trial the free Muse listing on real tasks (rate limits and prompt logging unknown).
| T-0203, T-0204 | easy (prompts) | | | | queued |
| T-0207 | medium-hard (mobile sheet, state machine) | | | | after T-0191 |

## Blocked or waiting for Julio

- T-0186 notification settings: needs the server push work (T-0172), not approved.
- Phone checks: the Aa press on a voice note, the silent model load after restart, transcribe with real speech, the new settings screens (Integrations, Stickers). The last APK was built but not installed (the phone refused the USB install).
- Release: everything merged since v0.1.13 reaches the live web only with the next release.

## Recent events

- 2026-10-05: merged T-0206 (RepoMapper trial, `docs/audit/repomap-trial.md`): recommendation DROP. Our tasks mostly create new files, which a map of existing code cannot show; the maps only echoed the spec's "Read first" plus noise. Tool left at `~/.zilar-lead/tools/RepoMapper` (deletable).

- 2026-10-05: merged T-0205, the first MiniMax M3 task (clean first round) and the first squash merge: main gained exactly one commit `T-0205: ...` with the branch commits in its body.

- 2026-10-05: merged T-0200 (squash merges; its own merge still used the old flow). Follow-ups: T-0205 written; `docs/LEAD_PLAYBOOK.md` got a squash note. Checked for Julio: a shared warm start saves at most ~12k uncached tokens per session (first step of T-0201: input 12068, cache 0) and OpenCode forks keep the parent's folder, so not worth building.

- 2026-10-05: Julio approved the token-saving tasks: T-0202 (A), T-0203 (B), T-0204 (C) written. The lead updated `AGENTS.md` "Running tests" (quiet dot reporter, `pnpm gate` once, small sessions) and the spec rule in `CLAUDE.md` (Checks = single tests + `pnpm gate`); T-0194 and T-0195 Checks trimmed to match.

- 2026-10-05: merged T-0201 (runner connect test polls for "live"; fixes the CI flake Julio pasted). Token audit of worker sessions shown to Julio: fix rounds in the same long session (up to 217k context per step) are the main waste; proposals A/B/C (fresh session for fix rounds, quiet gate output, pre-review reuses the gate result) wait for his answer.

- 2026-10-05: MiniMax-M3 has no effort variants; a launch with `effort: low` fails with no reply. `effort: default` works (tested). T-0194 and T-0195 now say `effort: default`. Noted in `docs/LEAD_HANDOFF.md`.

- 2026-10-05: **main's history compacted** (Julio's request): 1,146 commits became 227, one per task; the final tree is identical, the 14 release tags `v0.1.0`..`v0.1.13` were re-created (same message and date) on the matching new commits and force-pushed; main force-pushed with a lease on the old sha `e80dfa25`. Backups: local branch `backup/main-pre-compact` and `~/.zilar-lead/compact/main-pre-compact.bundle` (verified). Untouched: `t0113-orig`, `archive/*`, `spike/T-0118-push`, old detached worktrees. Gate PASS on the new main. Commit hashes quoted in older task files and Reviews point to the old history (still in the backup).
- 2026-10-05: merged T-0173 (Effect 4.0 spike, `docs/EFFECT_GUIDE.md`) after a lead nits round; a second power cut overnight lost nothing.
- 2026-10-04: merged T-0196 (the doctor), T-0187 (mobile sticker packs; `addStickerFavorite` deferred to the first star button) and T-0188 (mobile owner integrations), all with emulator smoke PASS for the mobile ones.
- 2026-10-04: Julio: easy exact tasks move to `minimax-coding-plan/MiniMax-M3` (his subscription) to spend less on Muse; pre-reviews stay on Muse. `lead switch-model` back to Muse if one needs more than 2 fix rounds.
- 2026-10-04: merged T-0199 (pre-review follow-ups) and T-0198 (state writes re-read the file first).

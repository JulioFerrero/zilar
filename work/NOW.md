# Now

The live picture: what runs, what is next, what waits for Julio. The lead rewrites this file after every launch, merge or block, and commits it with the board. The full task list is `BOARD.md`; the rules are `CLAUDE.md` and `docs/LEAD_LOOP.md`.

Last updated: 2026-10-05, after the history compaction and the T-0200 launch.

## Running (max 4)

| Task | What | Step | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| T-0200 | `lead merge` lands each task as ONE commit on main | coding | runs alone: it changes how every later task merges |

## Next, in order

1. T-0194 guard tests for the Android and Hermes pitfalls (MiniMax M3 trial), after T-0200 merges
2. T-0195 audit of web vs mobile, feeds the specs of T-0189 and T-0190 (MiniMax M3 trial)
3. T-0191 sticker editor and Telegram import

## Blocked or waiting for Julio

- T-0186 notification settings: needs the server push work (T-0172), not approved.
- Phone checks: the Aa press on a voice note, the silent model load after restart, transcribe with real speech, the new settings screens (Integrations, Stickers). The last APK was built but not installed (the phone refused the USB install).
- Release: everything merged since v0.1.13 reaches the live web only with the next release.

## Recent events

- 2026-10-05: **main's history compacted** (Julio's request): 1,146 commits became 227, one per task; the final tree is identical, the 14 release tags `v0.1.0`..`v0.1.13` were re-created (same message and date) on the matching new commits and force-pushed; main force-pushed with a lease on the old sha `e80dfa25`. Backups: local branch `backup/main-pre-compact` and `~/.zilar-lead/compact/main-pre-compact.bundle` (verified). Untouched: `t0113-orig`, `archive/*`, `spike/T-0118-push`, old detached worktrees. Gate PASS on the new main. Commit hashes quoted in older task files and Reviews point to the old history (still in the backup).
- 2026-10-05: merged T-0173 (Effect 4.0 spike, `docs/EFFECT_GUIDE.md`) after a lead nits round; a second power cut overnight lost nothing.
- 2026-10-04: merged T-0196 (the doctor), T-0187 (mobile sticker packs; `addStickerFavorite` deferred to the first star button) and T-0188 (mobile owner integrations), all with emulator smoke PASS for the mobile ones.
- 2026-10-04: Julio: easy exact tasks move to `minimax-coding-plan/MiniMax-M3` (his subscription) to spend less on Muse; pre-reviews stay on Muse. `lead switch-model` back to Muse if one needs more than 2 fix rounds.
- 2026-10-04: merged T-0199 (pre-review follow-ups) and T-0198 (state writes re-read the file first).

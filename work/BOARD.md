Claude maintains this file. Statuses are explained in [README.md](README.md).

## Active (M1 complete; next: M2 AIs that talk)

Claude runs the workers (DeepSeek V4.1 Flash, MiMo-V2.6-Flash, Muse Spark 1.3; **no V4 Pro**, Julio 2026-09-28) through OpenCode 2 (Julio's authorization, 2026-09-27). Each task gets its own git worktree `../galena-T-XXXX`. Watch a worker live with `cd ../galena-T-XXXX && opencode2 -s <session>`.

| ID | Title | Status | Model | Depends on | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| T-0034 | M2: AIs reply in their DM (log in as the AI, context from §9.2, LiteLLM call with the AI's capped key, budget-exceeded message) | planned | | T-0033 | Spec after T-0033 lands. Group @mentions come after AIs can join rooms. |
| [T-0037](T-0037-mobile-my-ais.md) | Mobile: My AIs list + Create-AI wizard (same `/api/ais` contract as T-0032), screenshots of every state | in progress | deepseek-v4.1-flash | T-0032 | UI task on Flash (vision). Own simulator only; Julio's iPhone/iPad untouched. |
| T-0005 | Spike S3: push chain, ejabberd → relay → Expo Push → iPhone | planned | v4-pro | T-0004 | Needs an Apple Developer account |

## Follow-ups

- Deployment: set Better Auth `advanced.ipAddress` for the real proxy (from the T-0015 review).
- OAuth (Google/Apple/GitHub): first-time users must carry the invite through the redirect (from the T-0015 review).
- **Real GitHub App wiring for the git proxy (needs Julio's GitHub account).** T-0009 proved the token lifecycle and the `agent/<ai>/*` branch rule with fakes. Still unproven: that GitHub accepts the App JWT and mints an installation token, and the pkt-line ref parsing against a real `git` client. A worker cannot create the App, so this needs a human.
- `apps/mobile/ios/` is generated and gitignored: run `pnpm --filter @galena/mobile boot:ios --device <udid>` after any native dependency change (T-0031). Running it in CI needs a macOS runner (Julio's decision).

- **M3 tunnel hardening (from the T-0008 spike):**
  - TLS/wss;
  - runner public keys stored in Postgres, plus pairing codes;
  - preview-token expiry and room-member authorization;
  - an https gateway upstream (today it is http-only);
  - a durable runner registry.

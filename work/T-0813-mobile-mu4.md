# T-0813 (MU4): mobile lib native: attachment-native, voice-native (expo-file-system, expo-audio) on Effect

## Spec (written by Claude, do not edit)

### Why
This is Phase 3 of `docs/audit/effect-100-plan.md` (task MU4), accepted by Julio on 2026-10-09. It runs in **wave 2** of the batch mode: the lead checks the whole wave once and sends every failure back.

### Verified facts (do not re-derive)
- **The files**, with each first non-Effect line from the plan appendix (re-read the file, because lines move):
  - `apps/mobile/src/lib/attachment-native.ts` (442 lines; first hit at line 10: native module import @10; async/await/Promise @88; try/catch @108), tested in `attachment-native.test.ts`;
  - `apps/mobile/src/lib/voice-native.ts` (414 lines; first hit at line 161: async/await/Promise @161; try/catch @162), tested in `voice-native.test.ts`;
- **The mobile Effect toolkit** (T-0800) is in `apps/mobile/src/lib/effect/`: `runtime.ts` (`runMobile`, `mobileAtomRuntime`), `errors.ts` (`ApiFailure`, `toApiFailure`), `api-effect.ts` (`fromApi`), `use-action.ts` and `use-query.ts`. They have the same API as the web hooks; read their header comments.
- **Mobile API modules** (`apps/mobile/src/lib/*-api.ts`) throw per-module errors with `status`, `code` and `message`; `fromApi` maps them to `ApiFailure`.
- **Native modules** (expo-*, react-native APIs) stay imported; their calls are wrapped with `Effect.tryPromise`, `Effect.try` or `Effect.callback`.
- **Expo inlines only a literal `process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_*`.** Since R5 (T-0803), the mock env comes from `apps/mobile/src/mock/gate.ts`; if a file here still reads `process.env`, import from there when the constant exists, or leave the read (W7) and say so.

### What to build
Convert the listed files.

Use the rules in `docs/EFFECT_BRIEF.md` (Web UI applies to React Native too): `useAction` per row, store `Error` messages kept, the same texts and behaviour, timers as `Effect.sleep` or `Schedule` fibers interrupted on unmount, and permission prompts (microphone, camera, notifications) still started directly from the press handler.

### Read first
`AGENTS.md`, `docs/EFFECT_BRIEF.md`, every file in `apps/mobile/src/lib/effect/`, the listed files and their tests.

### Allowed files
`apps/mobile/src/lib/attachment-native.ts`, `apps/mobile/src/lib/voice-native.ts`, `work/T-0813-mobile-mu4.md`.

### Checks (wave mode: your own tests and the mobile typecheck only; no whole suite, no `pnpm gate`)
```bash
pnpm --filter @zilar/mobile exec vitest run --reporter=dot src/lib/attachment-native src/lib/voice-native
pnpm --filter @zilar/mobile typecheck
```
Run `pnpm exec prettier --write` on your changed files before committing. Do not start the emulator or Metro; the lead runs `pnpm phone:smoke` for the wave.

### Acceptance
- Each listed file is `effect` in `pnpm effect:map`, or `plain` when no async work of its own is left (no added Effect import just for the label).
- The texts and behaviour are the same, or each difference is listed in the Report.
- Existing tests pass unchanged, new tests pass both before and after the conversion, and the mobile typecheck is clean.
- Only Allowed files change.

# T-0790: WU26: ChatList, MessageBubble, App on Effect (fire-and-forget calls and the try/catch sites)

## Spec (written by Claude, do not edit)

### Why
This is Phase 3 of `docs/audit/effect-100-plan.md`, accepted by Julio on 2026-10-09.

### Verified facts (do not re-derive)
- **The files**, with their lines and signals from `pnpm effect:map` on main `82db347b` (H1 async, H3 timers, W4 try/catch):
  - `apps/web/src/components/ChatList.tsx` (444, W4), tested in `ChatList.test.tsx`;
  - `apps/web/src/components/MessageBubble.tsx` (841, W4), tested in `MessageBubble.forward.test.tsx` and others (`ls apps/web/src/components/MessageBubble*`);
  - `apps/web/src/App.tsx` (27, W4), tested in `App.test.tsx`.
  - All three have only W4 (try/catch). Read each one: a pure total parse uses `parseUrl` or `safeDecode` from `@zilar/chat-core` (T-0765); a fire-and-forget store or API call becomes an Effect run with `runWeb` or `useAction`.
- **The hooks** are in `apps/web/src/lib/effect/`. The finished models are `apps/web/src/routes/BlockedPage.tsx` (per-row actions, T-0767), `apps/web/src/components/NewGroupDialog.tsx` (a debounced `useQuery` and typed validation errors, T-0773), and `apps/web/src/routes/StickersPage.tsx` (a page-level dialog with per-row actions, T-0783).
- **The full web suite passes on main** (1813 tests). Your change must keep it green, including other components' tests that render your files. Run the whole web suite once before you finish (`pnpm --filter @zilar/web test --maxWorkers=4 --reporter=dot`).

### The conversion pattern (same for every web UI task)
- **The goal:** after this task each listed file imports Effect for its async work, and contains no `async`, `await`, `.then(`, `try`/`catch`, `setTimeout` or `setInterval` of its own. That is the rule of `docs/audit/effect-100-plan.md` §1.3 and §3.6.
- **Use the hooks from T-0762** (`apps/web/src/lib/effect/use-action.ts`, `use-query.ts`; read their header comment):
  - `useAction(fn)` for user actions (submit, delete, toggle). It returns `[state, run, controls]`, and its `ignore` mode replaces the `busy` guards;
  - `useQuery(make, deps)` for loads, with `refresh` for reloads;
  - `failureOf(state)` and `isWaiting(state)` for the UI.
- **Calling existing API functions:** use `fromApi(() => apiFn(...))` (`apps/web/src/lib/effect/api-effect.ts`). It gives typed `ApiFailure` errors, which have `code`, `status` and `message`.
- **Timers and polling:** use `Effect.sleep`, `Effect.repeat` with `Schedule.spaced` or `Schedule.fixed`, inside `useQuery` or an atom, so unmount interrupts them. Debounce with `Effect.sleep` inside `useQuery` keyed on the input.
- **Keep the concurrency per item.** When a list has a button on each row, each row gets its own `useAction` (a small row component), so different rows can run at the same time while a double click on one row is still ignored. One `useAction` for the whole page would drop a second row's click (the lead's T-0767 review).
- **Keep the rendered structure.** Dialogs (`components/ui/dialog.tsx` is a non-portalled `fixed inset-0` overlay), lists and sections stay where they are in the tree. Moving a dialog into a row can clip it or stack it under other content (the lead's T-0783 review).
- **Non-API failures** may show the component's fixed fallback sentence instead of raw error text (`AGENTS.md`: fixed sentences). Mention it in the Report. **Exception:** a chat-store action that rejects with a plain `Error` carries a user-facing sentence the store wrote, so keep showing its `message`, as GroupPanel does since T-0781. Only non-`Error` causes get the fallback.
- **User-facing text stays byte-identical**, including the error sentences, labels and disabled states. A component keeps its props and exports.
- **Tests:** the existing tests must pass unchanged. A test that fakes `fetch` or an API module keeps working, because `fromApi` calls the same functions. Do not edit an existing test unless it asserts an implementation detail that cannot survive (for example a spied `setTimeout`); if so, explain each edit in the Report.
- **Check APIs in `node_modules/effect/dist/*.d.ts`** (Effect 4.0.2), not from memory.

### What to build
Convert the listed files with the pattern.

### Read first
`AGENTS.md`, `docs/EFFECT_GUIDE.md`, `docs/audit/effect-100-plan.md` §3.6, `apps/web/src/lib/effect/use-action.ts`, `apps/web/src/routes/BlockedPage.tsx`, the listed files and their tests.

### Allowed files
`apps/web/src/components/ChatList.tsx`, `apps/web/src/components/MessageBubble.tsx`, `apps/web/src/App.tsx`, `work/T-0790-web-list-bubble-app.md`.

### Checks
```bash
pnpm --filter @zilar/web test --reporter=dot src/components/ChatList src/components/MessageBubble src/App
pnpm gate
```
Run `pnpm effect:map` and list each file's kind in the Report, then run the whole web suite once and paste its summary.

### Acceptance
- Each listed file imports Effect, with no async, timers, raw storage or try/catch of its own.
- The text and behaviour are the same, or each difference is listed in the Report; the old tests pass unchanged, any new tests pass, and the whole web suite is green.
- `pnpm gate` ends with GATE PASS and lists no file outside the Allowed files.
